# Welcome to DnD-AI!


Each year, 10 million Dungeons and Dragons sessions are created, but did you know that more than half of these cannot take place due to a `lack of a Dungeon Master?` Dungeons and Dragons is a game that relies entirely on the imagination of its players, and among them, the Dungeon Master is `the one who creates the story` the players will follow, develops characters, their abilities, monsters, maps, and items – essentially, `the heart of the game`. We depend heavily on them, and there isn't always someone willing to take on the role.

What if we replaced them with an `artificial intelligence` that is available at all times? One that allows you and your friends to play a quality session whenever you want, `generating the map and enemies` automatically. That's us, DnD-AI, and we want to offer you this new way of playing – much more focused on immediate gameplay and with a faster pace.

Unlike similar ideas, we have various visual enhancements, such as `real-time map` visualization and the `generation of images` for the epic scenes that, until now, you could only imagine.
